# Linux scripts

Scripts for Linux hosts. Unless otherwise noted, these scripts should be compatible with any Linux OS (Debian-family, i.e. Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, RedHat-family, i.e. RedHat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, etc).

[Bash](./bash/) scripts may not be fully compatible with other shells (i.e. `zsh` on Mac or Linux, `fish`, etc). To ensure compatibility, run commands with `/bin/bash path/to/bash_script.sh`.
