# Chocolatey Package Manager

[Chocolatey](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/) is a very popular 3rd party package manager that has been around for a long time. The ecosystem has matured over that time, leading to a very wide range of packages and capabilities. The downside to this is that there are a number of unmaintained and out of date packages in the repositories, and the sheer number of options can be offputting to new users.

`chocolatey` is scriptable and popular in enterprises, even offering a paid enterprise version.
