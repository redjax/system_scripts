# Winget Package Manager

[`winget`]() is a package manager for Windows that [Microsoft unceremoniously stole from a developer](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277863/microsoft-winget-windows-package-manager-appget-response-credit-comment). It is built-in as of Windows 11 and offers a wide range of packages and a simple CLI (thank you to [Keivan Beigi for the original concept](https://medium.com/@keivan/the-day-appget-died-e9a5c96c8b22)).
